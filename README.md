# AutonomousNXPCar
The NXP cup is a car racing competition where a microcontroller is used to interface with the components on a Freescale car. 
There are different types microcontrollers that are capable of controlling the car, this paper presents the use of Freedom 
Development Platform for Kinetis 64 (FRDM- K64) microcontroller and explains the hardware connections between the K64 
microcontroller and the car, the software implementations of the microcontroller, and the challenges encountered as setting 
up the car. Throughout the process of preparing and testing the car for the competition, most known issues were resolved.
Due to the fact that the car could not to complete the entire track, some possible improvements for future projects are also 
mentioned.

The purpose of Rochester Institute Technology (RIT) NXP Car Challenge of Fall 2018 was to improve and enforce the understanding
of many fundamental principles that students learned from Interface & Digital Electronics (IDE) course and laboratory to design
a real-world application such as an autonomous driving car in a smaller scale. Such design and implementation have to meet the
given requirements. There were 21 participated teams in the race. Throughout the designing and implementation phase, many 
challenges rose to maintain the car within the track within a reasonable speed. Adjustment and tuning were performed up until
the race began to improve the stability and the performance of the car.
